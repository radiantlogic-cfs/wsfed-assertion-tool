# WsFed Client

## CFS Configuration

Create a Generic WsFed application in CFS:

- set `https://cfs-master:44303` as the `Realm`

## App Configuration (with an IDE)

Open your web application in Visual Studio and open the file `appsettings.json` at the root of the web application. Locate the `auth:wsfed` section.

- replace the value for `Wtrealm` with the same _Realm_ from CFS (`https://cfs-master:44303`);
- replace the value for `IdPMetadata` with the _Metadata URL_ from CFS (
  `https://cfs-master:44303/FederationMetadata/{tenant}/{appid}/FederationMetadata.xml`);
- replace the value for `Tenant` with the _Tenant Name_ from CFS;
- replace the value for `AppId` with the _Application ID_ from CFS;
- replace the value for `IdPHost` with the _CFS URL_ (`https://cfs-master:44303`);
- replace the value for `PostLogoutRedirect` with the URL the user should be redirected to after logout (`https://myapp:44310/Home/Index`).

## App Configuration (IIS deployment)

Go to the folder where the application source is located and go to the `WsFed MVC` -> `Published` folder. Open the file `appsettings.json` with a text
editor (_Notepad_). Locate the `auth:wsfed` section.

- replace the value for `Wtrealm` with the same _Realm_ from CFS (`https://cfs-master:44303`);
- replace the value for `IdPMetadata` with the _Metadata URL_ from CFS (
  `https://cfs-master:44303/FederationMetadata/{tenant}/{appid}/FederationMetadata.xml`);
- replace the value for `Tenant` with the _Tenant Name_ from CFS;
- replace the value for `AppId` with the _Application ID_ from CFS;
- replace the value for `IdPHost` with the _CFS URL_ (`https://cfs-master:44303`);
- replace the value for `PostLogoutRedirect` with the URL the user should be redirected to after logout (`https://myapp:44310/Home/Index`).

## Preview

Sample WsFed client application using .NET 8.

The homepage contains a link to the Dashboard labelled "Login" which will redirect to the OP for authorization first, since we are not logged in yet.

![Homepage](WsFed%20MVC/Docs/Resources/Images/homepage.png)

After logging in to the OP and authorizing the application, we will be redirected back to the [Dashboard](Views/Home/Dashboard.cshtml), where we can
see the user's claims.

From the Dashboard we can Logout, which will end the session here at the RP, and then will redirect to the OP's `logout`
endpoint.
